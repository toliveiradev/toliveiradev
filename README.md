- Specializing in **Artificial Intelligence** at the **UFV** through a post-graduate program.

## ðŸ”§ What I'm Good At

- **Languages:** Python, R, Octave and Java.
- **AI Trio (ML/DL/CV):** Building end-to-end AI solutions that combine Machine Learning algorithms, Deep Learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers), and Computer Vision techniques. I approach these three domains as an integrated skillset, moving fluidly between them based on problem requirements.
- **Software Development:** Building robust and scalable systems with a solid foundation in object-oriented programming and experience with functional programming concepts.
- **Mathematical Foundations:** Leveraging my mathematics background to understand better and implement complex AI algorithms and statistical models.

## ðŸ§  AI Focus Areas

- **Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Computer Vision:** Working at the intersection of these complementary fields to build comprehensive AI solutions.
- **Neural Network Architectures:** From traditional ML models to advanced deep learning structures for image recognition, NLP, and more.
- **Data Processing Pipelines:** Creating end-to-end workflows from data acquisition to model deployment.
- **AI Applications:** Applying my ML/DL/CV toolkit to solve problems in various domains including healthcare, finance, and automation.

## ðŸ“š AI & Mystery Novels Enthusiast

Fun Fact: When I'm not wrestling with the latest AI innovations, I enjoy unwinding with a good mystery novel. I thrive on finding patterns and piecing together solutions, whether it's in a machine learning challenge, a complex neural network, a computer vision problem, or a thrilling whodunnit. Let's connect and swap ideas if you're into any aspect of AI or a good mystery!

## ðŸŒ± What's Keeping Me Busy

- **Building:** Developing integrated solutions that leverage ML algorithms, DL architectures, and CV techniques together to solve interesting problems.
- **Learning:** Balancing my mathematics studies with hands-on AI projects while keeping up-to-date with advancements across the ML/DL/CV spectrum.
- **Contributing:** Passionate about open-source projects in all three domains (ML, DL, CV). Always looking for collaborations where I can apply my full AI toolkit.
- **Connecting Theory & Practice:** Applying mathematical concepts from my studies to enhance model performance, neural network design, and image processing algorithms.

## ðŸ’– Open Source Contributor

I'm a big believer in the power of open-source software and love working on projects that leverage Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision together.
